#Play level variable can be accessed by all the tasks and roles
#Task level variable can be accessed only by that task
#Role level variable is accessible in that role tasks
#Variable from cli is having higher precedence of any variable

#IMP: if the value of any key is a variable then double quote it
# ex: msg: {{ URL }}, this needs to be given as msg: "{{ URL }}
